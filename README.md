The purpose of this repository is to make various tasks regarding variadics and interfaces easier to perform.

The documentation for this library will be expanded in the future.  For now, please see the tutorials.go file to learn about the different functions.

Tutorial script does NOT currently include a tutorial for: PointersEqual, GetKeysValsFromMap, CloneInterface needs to be updated in name to CloneStruct (see https://go.dev/play/p/kcEoWCXILf-)
